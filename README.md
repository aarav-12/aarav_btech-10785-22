Task Management System (Kanban Based)
Overview

This project is a Kanban-style Task Management System built as part of an SDE assignment.
It focuses on clean backend architecture, secure authentication, and end-to-end task flow, while keeping the UI intentionally minimal and easy to run.

The application allows authenticated users to manage their own tasks across three states — Pending, In Progress, and Completed following a Kanban workflow.

Tech Stack
Backend

Node.js

Express.js

Passport.js (GitHub OAuth)

express-session

dotenv

Frontend

HTML

Vanilla JavaScript

Minimal CSS

Authentication

GitHub OAuth (session-based)

Features
Authentication & Access Control

Login using GitHub OAuth

Logout support

Session-based authentication

Protected task routes (unauthenticated users cannot access tasks)

Task Management

Create, view, and delete tasks

Update task status (Kanban flow)

Tasks are user-specific

Filter tasks by status

Task Fields

Each task includes:

title

description

status (pending / in-progress / completed)

due_date

created_at

userId

Kanban Board

The frontend displays a Kanban-style board with three columns:

Pending

In Progress

Completed

Tasks are fetched from the backend and rendered based on their status.
Instead of drag-and-drop, explicit status action buttons are used to move tasks between columns, ensuring clarity and reliable state updates via API calls.

API Endpoints
Authentication
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/auth/github	Login via GitHub
GET	/auth/github/callback	OAuth callback
GET	/auth/logout	Logout
Tasks (Protected)
Method	Endpoint	Description
GET	/tasks	Get all tasks for logged-in user
GET	/tasks?status=pending	Filter tasks by status
POST	/tasks	Create a new task
PATCH	/tasks/:id/status	Update task status
DELETE	/tasks/:id	Delete a task
Backend Setup
cd backend
npm install
node server.js


Server runs at:

http://localhost:5000

Frontend Setup

Open the frontend directly in the browser:

frontend/index.html


Login using GitHub and manage tasks via the Kanban board.

Environment Variables

Create a .env file inside the backend/ directory using .env.example.

GITHUB_CLIENT_ID=
GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET=

Design Decisions

GitHub OAuth was chosen over manual signup/login to avoid handling passwords and to ensure secure authentication.

In-memory task storage is used for simplicity and ease of setup. The data model is database-ready and can be extended to MongoDB or SQL without structural changes.

Kanban interactions are implemented through explicit status updates instead of drag-and-drop to keep the UI simple and reliable within limited time.

Priority was given to code clarity, modular structure, and correct authentication flow.

Error Handling

Invalid inputs return meaningful HTTP status codes

Unauthorized access returns 401

Missing resources return 404

Git Practices

Incremental commits

Clear and meaningful commit messages

No autogenerated or sensitive files committed

Future Improvements

Persistent database support

Drag-and-drop UI

User profile update endpoints

Automated tests

Deployment

Final Note

This project intentionally balances scope and correctness.
The focus is on building a reliable, readable system that demonstrates sound backend design and authentication practices.
